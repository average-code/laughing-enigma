# Let Us C Solutions  


This repository is dedicated to the solutions of coding examples presented in the book **Let Us C by Yashwant Kanetkar**

All the solutions are distributed in folders with the first character being the chapter number *1_Getting_Started*

I started this is a time pass exercise, but as I moved to the later I developed more and more efficient code  
while also appreciating the methods i used throughout, some of the things although repeated a lot of times in different chapters  
provide the different layers of a problem.

While progressing through the book there were a lot of **_"Eureka!"_** moments for me
I had a hold of using functions, but there were certainly times
where it became very clear and it only made me better than before.

I would recommend anyone starting with programming to try the questions, it will surely be helpful.
Thank you.

###### This post was created for my now-scrapped-blog which was a nice exercise at the start, but with time the idea of it became more obscure and due to some lack of postable content, because it is always best to post quality content instead of doing it for the sake of just doing it
